== WORDULAR

Wordular is a user-generated and curated dictionary. It is a place to store favourite words, find their definitions, add notes to words.

The application is built on a thin Rails API. The view is handled by React JS. The database is MySQL. I'm also using Babel to transpile ES6.

== TODO
* browser extension for 'right-click-functionality' for saving words
* finish refactoring for better use of ES6
* finish Android version using React-Native
